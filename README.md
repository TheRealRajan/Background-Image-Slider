# Background-Image-Slider
An Image Slider/Carousel that has a faded background of the image itself. <br><br>
The image in the foreground is cropped off and positioned in the middle of the screen so that the faded background lines up with the foreground creating a nice contrast between the two.<br><br>
When the **forward/backward** buttons are clicked the next/previous image slides in to replace it with a subtle animation.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Background-Image-Slider/* <br><br>
